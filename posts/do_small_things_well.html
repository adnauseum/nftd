        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <p>
          Often dictionaries are treated as the authorities that create and
          define the words that we use, but it's actually the other way around.
          People use the words and dictionaries record those usages. Put another
          way, dictionaries are descriptive not prescriptive. They are kind of
          like a changelog for the words in a given language. This is why they
          can help us peer into how ideas have developed over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, diet once meant “course of life: way of living or
          thinking.” as in: Javier and Patricia will never agree on how to raise
          children, they’re of such different diets. Similarly, in the late
          1950’s diet began referring to the absence of sugar in a carbonated
          beverage as in RC Cola’s Diet Rite or Pepsi’s first diet beverage
          called Patio.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you look up the definition of discipline in the Oxford English
          Dictionary, you’ll notice that it is replete with definitions but most
          of them can be squeezed into two senses:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Senses relating to punishment.</li>
          <li>Senses relating to training, instruction, or method.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Of note, discipline and disciple share a common root discere meaning
          “to learn.” The word docile also shares the same root as disciple and
          discipline: dek- meaning “to take, accept.” That’s why a student earns
          a doctorate when they complete a PhD program or your teacher’s
          teaching is orthodox (“correct” + “teaching”).
        </p>

        <p>
          To consolidate all of these floating ideas, we can say that discipline
          is something like the formation of something docile or the act of
          training something trainable.

        <h2>Minute punctilios</h2>
        <p>
          Three years into the French Indian War, a 25 year old George
          Washington sends instructions to his company captains. These
          instructions seem to be something more fit for the luxury of peacetime
          rather than frenzy of wartime. He instructs his captains to enforce
          discipline “even in the most minute punctilio’s” [sic].
        </p>

        <p><strong>Minute</strong>: small, bordering the insignificant.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Punctilio</strong>: a fine or petty point of conduct or
          procedure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Discipline is an attempt to keep something a certain way or gradually
          actualize what is potential. Washington understands the physics of
          this task. What is desired, a one-souled army, is the last thing to be
          actualized. Even more, Washington knows that this goal is procured, in
          part, by the small acts of discipline which lay the foundation for
          increasingly substantial improvement. That is the physics of
          actualizing what is potential. If you wish to go from London to New
          York, arriving at New York will be the last potential to actualize.
          All the requisite steps must first be executed. Washington’s emphasis
          on the small things, even during a war, reinforces the Aristotelian
          notion of virtue or excellence: “we are what we repeatedly do.”
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I also desire that the greatest regularity may be constantly
            observed in relieving the Guards, the Sentries, and all other parts
            of ceremonious duty: That the men may not by neglecting this,
            contract bad habits, but rather thro’ a strict observance, become
            intimately acquainted with, and knowing in their duty.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Ceremonious is an interesting adjective. Here’s the first sense in the
          OED:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Pertaining to, or consisting of, ceremonies or outward forms and
            rites
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          This entry OED even gives a definition using our new word, punctilio:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>According to prescribed or customary formalities or punctilios.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>

      <p>
        If we wish to be disciplined, we start by doing more disciplined
        things—ceremonious activity as it were. That doesn’t require discipline,
        per say. It requires inspiration and with time it can lead to
        discipline. We can affect what we become; doing well makes us well. This
        is at the heart of the tension of becoming what we are not yet, that is,
        the discomfort of actualizing a potential. Some of it comes from within
        and is then expressed outwardly and then re-absorbed again inwardly. For
        instance, I am inwardly moved to dress a little nicer today and, by that
        external ceremony, I am (maybe) more inclined to do other things well.
        It’s not a guarantor of excellence, but it is an assistant.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Excellence is an art won by training and habituation: we do not act
          rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have these
          because we have acted rightly; 'these virtues are formed in a person
          by their doing the actions'; we are what we repeatedly do. Excellence,
          then, is not an act but a habit: 'the good of the person is a working
          of the soul in the way of excellence in a complete life... for as it
          is not one swallow or one fine day that makes a spring, so it is not
          one day or a short time that makes a person blessed and happy'
        </p>

          >Will Durant, The Story of Philosophy (1926), p. 76. The quoted
          phrases within the quotation are from Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics,
          Book II, 4; Book I, 7.</cite
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Washington’s instructions challenge our tendency to undervalue the small
        points and overvalues the end goal, especially when we so greatly desire
        something. But this tendency tries defying the physics of change which
        says that we cannot become something instantly. We have to become
        something over time. “It is not one swallow or one fine day that makes a
        spring, so it is not one day or a short time that makes a person blessed
        and happy.”

        <h2>Execute the minute punctilios well.</h2>
        <p>
          For the parts of life that we can influence, we are the captains.
          Washington’s letter instructs us to discipline, or train, our members
          to produce an army of parts united by one soul. We can then act as a
          unanimous (“one” + “soul”) whole, more capable of consistent execution
          of what we desire. The minute punctilios in the course of our day are
          opportunities to build momentum and counteract the phenomenon
          described by the

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The broken windows theory is a criminological theory that states
            that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil
            disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime
            and disorder, including serious crimes. The theory suggests that
            policing methods that target minor crimes, such as
            vandalism,drinking, jaywalking and fare evasion, help to create an
            atmosphere of order and lawfulness, thereby preventing more serious
            crimes. loitering, public

        <p>
          Capitalize on the small points as opportunities to execute well. Keep
          your workspaces clean, dress nicer than you were planning, make your
          bed, change a loved one’s diaper like you’re trying to make art, act
          from rational calculation not impulse, speak kindly—do well to become
          well.

            I injoin it upon you, therefore, to use every means which you and
            your Officers shall judge advisable, to answer this salutary
            purpose—particularly by keeping out constant scouting parties; who
            with diligence, care and precaution, are to range all those parts
            thro’ which the Enemy make their inroads: and, when the enemy draw
            near the Quarter you are in, to exert your utmost efforts in
            preventing the inhabitants from suffering, by giving them all the
            intelligence you can of their danger, and by endeavouring to cover
            them, by way-laying those defiles, thro’ which the enemy are most
            likely to pass, before they can penetrate into the Inhabitants.
          </p>
          <p>
            These parties are to consist of such numbers as the service may
            require, and your circumstances will admit: But in general, I wou’d
            have a third part of your well men, and an officer (frequently, if
            not always to command; altho’ he may judge the party too small for
            his rank.)
          </p>
          <p>
            You are by no means to impress Horses yourself, or licence any
            person or persons under your command to do it, except in cases of
            necessity and where the Interest of the service indispensably
            requires it for Expresses, &amp;c. and then you are to be careful in
            seeing that, as soon as the service is performed, they be
            immediately returned to their proper Owners in good order; paying
            the hire of them; or else to give a certificate, specifying for what
            service they were pressed, and how long employed in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not to accommodate any Indians, that may happen to pass your
            way, with Horses, unless it be upon extraordinary cases; nor are you
            to hold any conferrences with them upon Business, only on such
            points as relate to the Service in which you are immediately
            engaged. Neither are you to attempt making Treaties with them, or to
            make them presents, promises, &amp;c. or give any liqour, but in a
            very sparing manner.

            If at any time or upon any occasion, you shou’d pay away money for
            contingent Expences, you are to take receipts for them, ascertaining
            the sum, &amp; for what service paid, and keep an exact accompt
            thereof, in order to lay it before me, or any other person whom the
            Governor may think proper to substitute: and all Services done the
            public, for which you do not pay ready money, you are to give
            certificates, setting forth the nature and causes thereof, as
            aforesaid. And all accompts relative to provisions you are to settle
            with the Commissary, or agents whom the Governor shall appoint: and
            all that relate to your own and company’s pay, with the pay-master.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are to take care that only one pound of flour, and the like
            quantity of meat, be delivered to each man per day: and that no more
            women draw provisions, than in proportion as 6 to 100 men.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must prevent any provisions issuing without a written order from
            yourself, or the officer commanding in your absence—To have regular
            returns made out for that purpose—To cause all provisions to be
            exactly weighed, &amp;c.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are to use every imaginable precaution to prevent irregular
            suttling, licentious swearing, and all other unbecoming
            irregularities—and to neglect no pains or diligence in training your
            men (when off duty) to the true use and exercise of their arms; and
            teaching them in all other respects, the duties of their profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be particularly careful in seeing that they take proper care of
            their clothes and accoutrements; which you are to do, by inspecting
            narrowly, every Saturday at least, into their order; &amp; by
            punishing and making stoppages from those who have lost, sold, or
            otherwise made away with, or abused their things, till full
            reparation is had.
          </p>
          <p>
            That this piece of duty may be conducted with ease; divide your men
            into as many squads as there are Sergeants, and make it the duty of
            each Sergeant (who is to keep a Roll of their necessaries for that
            purpose) to see that the men of his squad have their clothes, arms,
            and accoutrements always together, and in good order. This method I
            recommend as an alleviation of, but not an excuse for the Officers
            to neglect this duty themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also desire that the greatest regularity may be constantly
            observed
            <a></a> in relieving the Guards, the Sentries, and all other parts
            of ceremonious duty: That the men may not by neglecting this,
            contract bad habits, but rather thro’ a strict observance, become
            intimately acquainted with, and knowing in their duty. And as I
            wou’d have the whole regiment, tho’ never so much divided at
            present, pursue the same system of discipline, even in the most
            minute punctilio’s—You are to send an alert Sergeant or corporal,
            and two or three men, fit for the Drill, to this place to be
            perfected therein; who, on their return, are to instruct the rest of
            your command.
          </p>
          <p>
            I recomend it to you, likewise, and in the strongest terms, that
            you, and the officers under your command, do make themselves masters
            of the necessary salutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are to give in an exact size, and necessary role of your
            company<a

            and to see that no non-commissioned officer or Soldier is ever
            provided with less than 3 good shirts, two pair of good Stockings,
            and one pair of good Shoes; and that the initial letters of their
            names are marked upon their ammunition, clothes, and accoutrements;
            which you must cause to be entered in a Book kept for that purpose,
            to prevent their swapping and changing their things. You are also to
            be vastly careful in making them preserve their Regimentals, and to
            make them appear always neat and clean, and soldier-like, especially
            when they are upon Duty.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are to transmit me the most exact and regular returns, made out
            once a month, not only of the strength of, and alterations in, your
            company (or command) but also of the arms, ammunition, clothes, and
            Stores, carefully examined by yourself, to prevent such egregious
            mistakes as often happen thro’ the negligence of the Officers, in
            trusting to the Sergeants: as, upon failure herein, you may depend
            upon being relieved and tried for disobedience of orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are also to hold me duly advised of all material occurrencies in
            your Quarter. You are not to give furlough’s to more than one
            Soldier at a time, unless some particular cause requires it; and
            then you are to insert the reasons and time of their absence at the
            foot of your return, if they shou’d not happen to be present at the
            time it is made. Shou’d any of your men desert, you are to use your
            utmost endeavours in having them apprehended; <a></a> and whatever
            expence you are at, over and above what the country allows, is to be
            deducted from the pay of such offending Soldiers, if they shou’d
            happen to be taken.

          <p>
            I expect you will take great pains to make your Soldiers good
            marks-men, by teaching them to shoot at Targets.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been thus particular in my Instructions to you, because I
            expect the most punctual obedience will be paid to them; being
            determined not to overlook neglects of duty in any, but to act with
            the utmost strictness (agreeably to the Instructions which I am
            honored with from the Governor) and therefore, in order to enable
            you to support a proper command—I hereby require, that you do put
            any officer under arrest, whom you shall find negligent in his duty,
            or misbehaving as a Gentleman, and either enquire into his conduct
            with your own Officers (in order to a further examination at this
            place) or send him here (at once) for that purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I do hereby direct you to hold courts martial for trying and
            punishing non-commissioned officers and soldiers (without which the
            former are not to be broke, and after which, by no means to be
            reinstated, nor new ones appointed, without my approbation). In all
            other respects you are to govern yourselves exactly agreeable to the
            articles of War, and the rules and customs of the army.
          </p>
          <p>
            Permit me, before I finish (and now that the companies are formed
            for service, and agreeable to order) to recommend, and I do in the
            strongest manner I can to you and your Officers; to devote some part
            of your leisure hours to the study of your profession, a knowledge
            in which can not be attained without application; nor any merit or
            applause to be atchieved without a certain knowledge thereof.
            Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers
            formidable; procures success to the weak, and esteem to all: and
            may, in a peculiar manner to us, who are in the way to be joined to
            Regulars in a very short time, and of distinguishing thro’ this
            mean, from other Provincials.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are to be at no expence in building or repairing old works,
            without first apprizing me thereof: Because the money appropriated
            to that purpose is expended. The safety and convenience of soldiers
            render it a duty upon them to repair the <a></a> works, and make
            lodgments for themselves. I wou’d therefore have you observe this,
            and act conformably to it.
